### Ionic: Advanced HTML5 Hybrid Mobile apps
Building a mobile app, can be a challenge to build if you decide to build a native application. Not only do you have to maintain code bases for each of the platforms you have to develop for you also have to deal with platform specific bugs and quirks. In the past years developing your application using HTML5 was frowned upon from developers to users, no one enjoyed having to maintain or create one. But as with any web technology this is quickly changing, with standards being completed and browsers starting to agree on common grown on issues we are seeing amazing advancement happening in this space.

For example on 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C recommended standard. But it does not end their, more and more releases are being pushed both in CSS3 and JS, as of August 2014, ECMAScript 6 is already feature frozen meaning that we are in the last parts of the software development cycle for ECMAScript 6.

What does all this mean? it means as developers we can start putting to use some of our existing knowledge about the web to start developing mobile applications that can have a competitive edge against the native counter parts. With shorter development life cycles, and with speed that will have you thinking twice if it was native or an HTML5 application. Allowing you to quickly develop and test your applications.
